#Prompt
I tried initializing myst in jupyterhub from my repo's home directory using 'myst init' but got this error:

Updating .gitignore EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, read Myst CLI Versions: - node 20.19.5 Required: >= 18.0.0 - npm 10.8.2 Required: >=8.6.0 - myst 1.6.3

#Response
That error means that the myst init command is trying to read a file, but it hit a directory with the same name it expected to be a file — most often .gitignore.

⚠️ Common cause
You probably have a folder named .gitignore/ instead of a file named .gitignore in your repo’s root.
